A title tooltip comes up when you scroll with the mouse over a piece of “manipulated” text or image. You know these from images or linked text. Here is how you can add this one to plain text.

Input:

<span title=”See, this is the tooltip. :)”>Move your mouse over me!</span>

Output demo:

Move your mouse over me!
